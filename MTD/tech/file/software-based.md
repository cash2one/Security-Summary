## Software-based Diversification

- [ref](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663486)

Existing works achieve Software-based Diversificiation via directly manipulating software or replying on compilers to produce diversification.

### Software Manipulation
- The technqiue of software manipulation enchances security via changing software functionality to eliminate vulnerabilities or limit their exposure. 
- Accretion, excision, and replacement of funtionality are all leveraged as manipulation mechanisms.
- Input rectification is an example ofa accretion mechanism.
- Via insrting functions to manipulate inputs in software, input rectification converts each input to stay in secure zone. For instance, the Pine email rectifier is developed to force messages into a specific constrained form. In order to simplify software behavior and possibly avoid vulnerabilities, functionality excision removes functional but non-critical sections of a program, which may introduce result noise, but normally will not cause failure. 
- Functionality replacement switches between different implementations of the same function in a program, and thus generate system variation to neutralize attacks.
