## Attack Phase

- [ref](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6673500)

### Reconnaissance
- This phase encompsasses the means by which attackers find the target andcollect basic information on it. It's mainly limited to observation to learn more about a targtt. Examples include findings an appropriate spear-phishing target or determine a host's location using basic IP scanning.

### Access
This phase covers actions attackers take to collect detailed information about a chosen target. For example, attackers might launch probes against a web server to determine the architecture, opearting system, exact server application version, or configuraton.

### Development
During this phase, attackers develop an attack that can exploit a vulnerability on a target. This phase can be performanced offline without any involvement of the target.

### Launch
The launch phase involves attackers deliverying the attack payload to the target to compromise it. The payload can be delivered avia a variety of means, such as over a network or through infected media, and might come in many forms, such as an instance of malicious executable code or large volumnes of otherwise benign data intended to overwhekm a server on the target.

### Persistence
If attackers mean to persit, this phase is used to ensure that they can maintain a foothold in the compromised syste,. On prominent example of ensuring persistence in stalling other entry points (for example, backdoors) on the target.
