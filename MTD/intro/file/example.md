## Examples


- Periodiacallly change the operating of a system that provides a critical service, to make it harder for attackers to exploit a specific OS's known vulnerabilities. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Restructruing a software-defined network's topology, which could disrupt attacks amounted through compromised nodes in the subne. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Changeing the address space layout to disrupt precoded buffer-overflow. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- IP-Hop-ping. IP-Hopping relies on changing a host's IP address to increase the complexity of network attacks such as communication eavesdropping and hijacking. By changing network address, most of the standard techniques for flow and session isoalation will likedly be disrupted, greatly increasing the complexity of mounting a successful attack.
