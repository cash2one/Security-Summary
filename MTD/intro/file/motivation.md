### Motivation

- Traditional static network
  - One of the criticisms of traditional security approaches is that they present a static target for attackers. Critics statm with good justification, that by allowing the attacker to recooniter a system at leisure to plan an attack, defenders are immediately disadvantaged. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
  - The static model tends to be much more costly to defenders than it is for attackers, who can choose when and what to exploit, while defenders have to protect all assets from any potential attack, all of the time. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
  - Currently, enterprise network configurations tend to be static, which gives attackers time to study our networks and vulnerabilities before attacking. Additionally, once they acquire a privilege, they can maintain it for a long time. [[Rui-2014]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602088)
- Combat the advantage of attacker
  - the static nature of current networks makes it easy to attack and breach a system and to maintain illegal access priviledges for extended periods of time.
