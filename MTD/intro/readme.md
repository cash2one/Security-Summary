## Definition of Moving Target Defense


### Definition
- Moving Target Defense(MTD) is the concept of controlling change across multiple system dimensions in order to increase uncertinaty and apparent complexity for attackers, reduce their window of opportunity and increase the costs of their probing and attack efforts [[DHS-GOV-2011]](http://www.dhs.gov/csd-mtd)

### How it works
- MTD techniques generally focus not on the shields that protect the targes but on the manipulation and control of the targets themselves, to create the perception of movement to attackers. The goal is to mitigate the assymmetric advantage of attackers by increasing the complexity, diversity, and uncertainty over the protected system's attack surface.

MTD systems broadly fall into two categories: proactive MTD and reactive MTD.
- Proactive MTD
  - In protactive MTD, possible adversrial behaviros are anticipated, and the corresponding defensive strategies are incorporated int othe system design to thwart attacks proactively without disrupting operations.
  - In addition, some elements of the defense system, such as Interent protocol (IP) addresses, port numbers, operating systems, etc., are diversified periodically to create a varying attack surface.
- Reactive MTD
  - In reactive MTD, systems react out of necessity to defend against a detected malicious attack.
