## Definition of Moving Target Defense


### Definition
- Moving Target Defense(MTD) is the concept of controlling change across multiple system dimensions in order to increase uncertinaty and apparent complexity for attackers, reduce their window of opportunity and increase the costs of their probing and attack efforts [[DHS-GOV-2011]](http://www.dhs.gov/csd-mtd)

### How it works
- MTD techniques generally focus not on the shields that protect the targes but on the manipulation and control of the targets themselves, to create the perception of movement to attackers. The goal is to mitigate the assymmetric advantage of attackers by increasing the complexity, diversity, and uncertainty over the protected system's attack surface. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)

### Motivation
- Traditional static network
  - One of the criticisms of traditional security approaches is that they present a static target for attackers. Critics statm with good justification, that by allowing the attacker to recooniter a system at leisure to plan an attack, defenders are immediately disadvantaged. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
  - The static model tends to be much more costly to defenders than it is for attackers, who can choose when and what to exploit, while defenders have to protect all assets from any potential attack, all of the time. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Combat the advantage of attacker
  - the static nature of current networks makes it easy to attack and breach a system and to maintain illegal access priviledges for extended periods of time. 

### Examples
- Periodiacallly change the operating of a system that provides a critical service, to make it harder for attackers to exploit a specific OS's known vulnerabilities. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Restructruing a software-defined network's topology, which could disrupt attacks amounted through compromised nodes in the subne. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Changeing the address space layout to disrupt precoded buffer-overflow. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)

### Challenge
- First and foremost, while a network's configuration can be amde more dynamic through constant changing, legitimate users still need to locate and access needed services.
