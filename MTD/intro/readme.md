## Definition of Moving Target Defense


### Definition
- Moving Target Defense(MTD) is the concept of controlling change across multiple system dimensions in order to increase uncertinaty and apparent complexity for attackers, reduce their window of opportunity and increase the costs of their probing and attack efforts [[DHS-GOV-2011]](http://www.dhs.gov/csd-mtd)


### Motivation
- Traditional static network
  - One of the criticisms of traditional security approaches is that they present a static target for attackers. Critics statm with good justification, that by allowing the attacker to recooniter a system at leisure to plan an attack, defenders are immediately disadvantaged. [[Mrco-2014]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6798537)
- Combat the advantage of attacker
  - the static nature of current networks makes it easy to attack and breach a system and to maintain illegal access priviledges for extended periods of time. 

### Challenge
- First and foremost, while a network's configuration can be amde more dynamic through constant changing, legitimate users still need to locate and access needed services.
