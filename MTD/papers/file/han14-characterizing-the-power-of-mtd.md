## [Characterizing the power of moving target defense via vyber epidemic dynamics](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2600180)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose an prooach of using cyber epidemic dynamics to characterize the powr of MID. The approach offeres algorithm for optimally deploying MTD, where "optimization" means maximizing the portion of time the system can afford to stay in an undesired configuration, or minimizng the cost of launching MTD when the system has to stay in an undesired configuration fora predetermined portion of time.



### Comments
- This paper focuses on theoretic analysis.

### TODO
- Understand their model and algorithms
