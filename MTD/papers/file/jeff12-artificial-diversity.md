## [Artificial Diversity as Maneuvers in a Control Theoretic Moving Target Defense](http://cps-vo.org/node/3710)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors analysis the weakness of DHCP protocols and propose a moving target defense mechanism. The defense mechanism acts by adding extra states. Besides, their mechanism rely on secure sensors which could measure the security in the specify scurity state.

They design movement which minimize the moving cost.

### TODO
- Investigate how their defense mechanism works in greater details.
