## [Simulation-based Approaches to Studying Effectiveness of Moving-Target Network Defense](http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~sdeloach/publications/Conference/MTD-MTR_Symposium_2012.pdf)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a model that enable moving target defense. In specific, their model is consistitued by various components including database server, web server etc.
Simulations are conducted to study the attack results ragrding different adaption time length.

### TODO
- Summarize related works
- Check how the attack graph is formed
