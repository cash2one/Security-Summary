### Summary
In this paper, the authors present the idea of introducing diversity and uncertainty to web service environment so that web services will be significantly more resilient to attacks. In specific, the attack surface is enlarged.

### Comments
This paper contains details descriptions of the diversity of application, operating system.

### Future work
- Increase diversity of course can reduce the probability of successful attack. Problems about how to move is not addressed yet.
