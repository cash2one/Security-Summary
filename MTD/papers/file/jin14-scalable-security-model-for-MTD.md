## [Scalable Security Models ofr Assessing Effectiveness of Moving Target Defense](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.mutex.gmu.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6903607)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors present a scheme HARM that could be used to model the risk/importance of system infrascture. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism is more scalable than using attack graph directly.
