## [OpenFlow Random Host Mutation: Transparent Moving Target Defense using Software Defined Networking](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2342467)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors proposed a moving target defense approach using software-defined networking.
- Objetive: to thwart scanning via random and unpreditable mutation of host IP addresses.
- How?: They formalized the problem of unpreditable and rapid mutation as determining a valid assignment of unused address ranges under multi-constraint satisfation.

### TODO
- Understand their analysis and algorithms in details.
