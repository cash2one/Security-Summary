## [Predictive Moving Target Defense](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378159)

### Summary
As the attackers can reverse-engineer the defense mechanisms, e.g., spam filters, thus a dynamic defense mechanism is highly desired. 

In this paper, the auhtors study a defense mechanism that takes into account the evolution of attackers based on maching learning to do prediction, and also model the problem using game theory. 

### TODO
- Look into the game theory details. (incomplete information game)
