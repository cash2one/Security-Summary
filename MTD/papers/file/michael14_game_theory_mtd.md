## [Empirical Game-Theoretical Analysis of an Adaptive Cyber-Defense Scenario](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12601-2_3)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors investigate the interation between defenders and attackers. They consider the scenario in which
- An attacker's ability of compromise a target server increases progressively with probing
- An the defender can erase attacker progress through a moving-target technique

They conduct game theoretic analysis of it.

### TODO
- Look into the game theoretical aspect of the analysis.
