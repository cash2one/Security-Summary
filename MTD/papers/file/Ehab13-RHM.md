## [Random Host Mutation for Moving Target Defense](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36883-7_19)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors present a movig target defense against stealthy scanig and worm propogatio attacks that require reconaissance for successful launching. The experimentation results shows that Random Host Mutation (RHM) could defeat random scanning tools by invalidating at least 97% of its discovery.

### TODO
- check how the mutation satisfy the routing and configuration constraints.
