## [Creating a cyber moving target for cirtical infrastructure applications using platform diversity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874548212000030)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors present their design of TALENT which provides dynamic, heterogenous platforms for critical infrastructure applications. It focuses more on dicussing the design details. Migration performance is measured.

### Future work
As this paper only focuses on building the system that enable migration. The followings things are to be addressed
- check recovery capabilities, since the platform may have already crashed before migration
- add detection engine so as to trigger migration
- assess the security risk based on attack graph

### Comments
- This paper is helpful for doing real implementation of migration.
