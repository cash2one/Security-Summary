## [Autonomic Resilient Cloud Management (ARCM)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7024043)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors discuss how to make use of MTD approach to secure the cloud computing. The experiment is running by testing the attack on the map-reduce application.
- Voting algorithm is designed to vote the computation result in terms of insider attack.

### Comment
- The structure of the MTD is a good example. But there is a centralized manager? Weak point?
- The use of voting algorithm is intersting. We should consider apply other algorithms in the field of MTD.
