## [Symbiotes and defensive Mutualism: Moving Target Defense](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0977-9_5#page-1)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors design a defense mechanism based on sofware symbiotes.
- In specific, the Symbiote is a self-contained code entity that does not depend on features within its host program to function. Instead, the Symbiote treats the host program as an external untrusted entity, and uses its own internal monitoring and analysis facilities to protect the host program.
- The Symbiote Monitoring Engine collects and organizes the runtime information about the system in which it resides.

### Comment
- The idea of using symbiotes is interesting. But I don't understand how the technique in this paper is related to moving target defense.
