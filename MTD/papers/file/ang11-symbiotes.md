## [Symbiotes and defensive Mutualism: Moving Target Defense](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0977-9_5#page-1)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors design a moving target defense mechanism based on sofware symbiotes.
- In specific, the Symbiote can be thought of as a fortified and self-constrainted execution environment that is infused into the host software.

### Comment
The idea of using symbiotes is interesting. Although it is not  related to the vm-based moving target defense.
