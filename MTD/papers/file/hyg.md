## [Hey, You, Get Off of My Cloud: Exploring Information Leakage in Third-Party Compute Clouds](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1653687)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors shows the vulnerability of current cloud infrastructures, i.e., the placement of virtual machines in the cloud. They demonstrate how to colocate vm with the target vms and thus can be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM.
