## [Multiple OS Rotational Environment-An Implementated Moving Target Defense](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6900086)


### Summary
- In this paper, the authors conduct experiment to study the effectiveness of MTD by rotating the OS periodically. In their experiment, they set the period as every 60 seconds, and every 5 minutes. They use testing tools to test the vulnerability that exposed to attackers.

### Merits
- The vulnerability detection tools used look good.

### Comments
- MTD should not be used to resist every kind of attack. For example, resist the detection of fingerprint of operating system. This is too costly for defenders for rotating the operating system every 60 seconds.
- I think the benefits of MTD is to let the attackers lose their gained priviledge from time to time. But moving without awre of the attackers is apparently not wise.
