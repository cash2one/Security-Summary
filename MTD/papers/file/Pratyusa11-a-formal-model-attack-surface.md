## [A Formal Model for a System's Attack Surface](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0977-9_1)


### Summary
In this paper the authors propose formal definition of attack surface.

### TODO
- Understand their defiition if you would like to measure the attack surface.
- Comments: it seems wierd that they measure the complexity of code by LOC but how this relates to security?
