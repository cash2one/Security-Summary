## [Towards A Theory of Moving Target Defense](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663479)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors define MTD defense and attackers formally. Based on these definition, the authors explain what is adaption. The challenge of MTD is to decide what to move and when to move, which can be regarded as a planing problem. In addition, the authors discusses about the configuration space and entropy and conclude the more entropy the better the defense mechanism is.

### Comments
These definitions contain not much novelty. The conclusion of the entropy is obvious.
