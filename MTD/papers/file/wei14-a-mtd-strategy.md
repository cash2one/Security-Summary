## [A Moving-target Defense Strateg for Cloud-based Services with Heterogeneous and Dynamic Attack Surface](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6883418)


### Summary
In this paper, the authors propose a moving target defense mechanism for a cloud-based service model. In this model, there is a pool of VMs to host services, some of them are active and some are inactive. The attackers are assume to be unaware of the state of VMs and thus conduct random attack on the VMs. Attackers have a budget which translates to the maximum number of VMs they can attack at the same time.

They define a probability function for the attackers to learn the VMs and based on this, they propose a moving target mechanism to move with probability ragarding to the risk.

### TODO
- Investigate more about the models their defined
- Check how they do the simulation

### Comment
- The paper is of good style.
