## [Moving Target Defense for Adaption Adversaries](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6578785)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors consider the adaptive adversaries and propose to use machine learning approach to defend against their reverse-engineering ability.

In specific, a Hidden Mode Hybrid Dynamic System (HM-HDS) is proposed with machine learning techniques employed. Two empirical case studies are conducted, one is spam filter, the other is network intrusion. The results demonstrate MTD is more effective compared with static approach.

### TODO
- I didn't go detail into their proof.
- The dataset used is kddcup99, which may be too old.
