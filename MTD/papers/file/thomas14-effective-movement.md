## [On the Challenges of Effective Movement](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663480)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors identify three primary challenges in achieving effective moving target defense.
- 1. Coverage
  - The movement of all elements of the attack surface defeneded by the technique
  - i.e., the attack surface has to be fully coverage
- 2. Unpredictability
  - The movement exposes a large entropy to the attacker
- 3. Timeliness
  - Refer to the synchronization of movements with attacker observation, i.e., is movement taking place in a large enough time
  - A movement can be applied between the time at which an attacker makes an observation and time at which an attack is completed
