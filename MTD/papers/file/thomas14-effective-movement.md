## [On the Challenges of Effective Movement](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663480)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors identify three primary challenges in achieving effective moving target defense.
- 1. Coverage
  - The movement of all elements of the attack surface defeneded by the technique
  - i.e., the attack surface has to be fully coverage
- 2. Unpredictability
  - The movement exposes a large entropy to the attacker
- 3. Timeliness
  - Refer to the synchronization of movements with attacker observation, i.e., is movement taking place in a large enough time
  - A movement can be applied between the time at which an attacker makes an observation and time at which an attack is completed

The authors show how these challenges manifest themselves in some of the well-known MT categories of ASLR, ISR and Software Diversity.



### TODO
- If want to know more details about the three chalenges, then read the example analysis including ALSR, ISR and Software Diversity.
