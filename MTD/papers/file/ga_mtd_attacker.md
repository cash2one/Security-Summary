## [Adaptive Attacker Strategy Development Against Moving Target Cyber Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.8540)

### Summary
In this paper, the author proposes a mechanism for the attackers to adapt to moving target defense strategy. The approach is based on generic algorithm (GA).
Initially, the attackers have several strategies, and the attackers can gain some benefits when consecutive compromise three platforms. 
- The authors simulate the attackers strategy against two migration-based moving target defense mechanism, one is randomized platform scheduling algorithm, the other is diversity maximizing approach.
- The simulation results show the effectiveness of GA-based algorithm, and demonstrate the differences in the defense strategies under the two defense mechanism.
