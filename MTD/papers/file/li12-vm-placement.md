## [Improving Cloud Survivability through Dependency based Virtual Machine Placement](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~myu/s-lab/publications/Li2012.pdf)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors model the attack probability of VMs under their dependency. In specific, they use DTMC to model it. Then they propose an algorithm which tries to seperate VMs with high and low risk. The experiment results demonstrate their algorithm is better than random placement, although their approach is not optimal.
