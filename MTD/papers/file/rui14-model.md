## [A Model for Analyzing the Effect of Moving Target Defenses on Enterprise Networks](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602088)

### Summary
In this paper, the authors model the moving target defense problem by consider a simple network graph. The motivation is to provide insight of configuring defense strength to guarantee security (measured by attacking likelihood). Part of the contents is suammrized [here](../../model)

### Highlight
- Adaption Interval: the time interval between each system adaption. 
  - If a node does not get adaption during the attack interval, it will have probability to be attacked.
