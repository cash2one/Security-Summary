## [Evolutionary Drift Models for Moving Target Defense](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2460018)

### Summary
This paper proposes an approach to detect attackers with evolutionary drift. They use the knowledge of biologic of distinguish similar sequence. The highlight of their approach is the idea of modeling evolutionary drfit.

### Comment
However, this paper seems should based on the assumption that attackers do evolve follow evolutionary drift.
