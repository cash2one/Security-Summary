## Background


### Attacks
- **Convert channel** [[Wang]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.190.1003&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
  - A convert channel users mechanisms that are not intended for communications, .e.g, writting and checking if a file is locked to convey a "1" or "0". In convert channel, an insider process leaks information to an outsider process not normally allowed to access that information. 
  - The insider (sending) process could be a Trojan horse program previously inserted stealthily into the computer.
  - An outsider (receiving) process need only to be an unpriviledged process.
- **Side channel** [[Wang]](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.190.1003&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
