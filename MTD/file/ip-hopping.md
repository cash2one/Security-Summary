## IP Hopping

### Intro
- IP-Hopping relies on changing a host's IP address to increase the complexity of network attacks such as communication eavesdropping and hijacking. By changing network address, most of the standard techniques for flow and session isoalation will likedly be disrupted, greatly increasing the complexity of mounting a successful attack.
