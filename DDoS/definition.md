DDoS Attack
---

### Definition

### How
- Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computer by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies(i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. [Zargar-2013]()


### How to launch DDoS attack
Currently, there are two methods to launch DDoS attack in the Internet. 

1. The attacker can send some malformed packets to the victim to confuse a protocol or an application running on it(i.e., vulnaribility attack[[Mirkovic-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=997156)).

2. A more common one approach, the attackers trying to do one or both of the following
	- disrupt a legitimate users connectivity by exhuasting **bandwidth**, router processing capacity or network resources; they are essentiallly network/transport-level attacks[[Mirkovic-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=997156)), or
	- disrupt a legitimate users' service by exhausting the **server resources** (e.g., sockets, CPU, memory, disk/database bandwidth, and I/O bandwidth); these essentially include application-level flooding attacks[[Ramkam-2006]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4146780&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D4146780).

### Purpose
- DDoS flooding attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services.
