DDoS Attack
---

### Definition

### How
- Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computer by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies(i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. [Zargar-2013]()

### Purpose
- DDoS flooding attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services.
