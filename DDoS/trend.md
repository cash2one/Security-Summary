### Attack size
- DDoS attacks are also increasing in size, making them harder to defense against. 
- Arbor Networks found that there has been around 100% increase in the attack size over 2010, with attacks breaking the 100Gps barrier for the first time[[Arbor-Report]](http://www.arbornetworks.com/resources/infrastructure-security-report).
