### Botnet
- botnets are the dominant mechanisms that facilitate DDoS flooding attacks on computer networks or applications
- most of the recent and most problematic application layer DDoS flooding attacks have employed botnets



### Defense Challenge
According to [[Peng-2007]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1216373) , there are two main reasons that make the development of an effective DDoS defense mechanism even more challenging when attacker employ zombies to launch DDoS flooding attacks.

- First, A large number of zombies involved in the attack facilitates attackers to make the attacks larger in scale and more disruptive.
- Second, zombies' IP addresses are usually spoofed under the control of the attacker, which makes it very difficult to traceback the attack traffic even to the zombies.
- [X]: (For our designed moving target defense, we can prevent spoofed IP address attack.)
