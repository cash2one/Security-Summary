These attacks have been mostly launched using TCP, UDP, ICMP and DNS protocol packets.There are for types of attacks in this category [[Mirkovic-2006]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=997156),[[Douligeris-2004]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128603004250).

#### Flooding attacks
- Attackers focus on disrupting legitimate user's connectivity by exhausting victim network's bandwidth (e.g., Spoofed/non-spoofed UDP flood, ICMP flood, DNS flood, VoIP flood and etc [[Pend-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1216373) [[RioRey-2012]](https://www.scribd.com/doc/92863121/RioRey-Taxonomy-DDoS-Attacks-2-2-2011) ).


#### Protocol exploitation flooding attacks
- Attackers exploit specific fetures or implementation bugs of some of victim's protocols in order to consume excess amounts of the victim's resources (e.g., TCP SYN flood, TCP SYN-ACK flood, ACK & PUSH ACK flood, RST/FIN flood and etc [[Pend-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1216373) [[RioRey-2012]](https://www.scribd.com/doc/92863121/RioRey-Taxonomy-DDoS-Attacks-2-2-2011) ).
