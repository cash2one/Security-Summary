DDoS Attackers' Incentive
---

DDoS Attackers are usually motivated by various incentives. We can categorize DDoS attacks based on the motivation of attackers into 5 main categories: [[Zargar-2013]](https://github.com/hxwang/Security-Summary/blob/master/ZargarJ13_Survey_Defense-Mechanism-against-DDoS.md)
#### *Financial/economical gain*
These attacks are a major concern of corporations. Because of the nature of their incentive, attackers of this category are usually the most technical and the most experienced attackers. Attacks that are launched for financial gain are often the most dangerous and hard-to-stop attacks.

#### *Revenge*
Attackers of this category are generally frustrated individuals, possibly with lower technical skills, who usually  carry out attacks as a response to a perceived injustice.


#### *Ideological belief*
 Attackers who belong to this category are motivated by their ideological beliefs to attack their targets [[Fultz-2009]](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-03549-4_10#page-1).  This category is currently one of the major incentives for the attackers to launch DDoS attacks. For instance political incentives have led to recent sabotages in [Iran 2009](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Slowloris+and+Iranian+DDoS+attacks/6622) and [Wiki Leaks-2010](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/28/wikileaks-ddos-attack/)

 
 #### *Intellectual Challenge*
 Attackers of this category attack the targeted systems to experiment and learn how to launch various attacks. They are usually young hacking enthusiasts who want to show off their capabilities. Nowadays, there exist various easy to use attack tools and botnests to rent that even a computer amateur can avail of in order to launch a successful DDoS attack.
 
 #### *Cyberwarfare*
 - Attackers of this category usually belong to the military or terrorist organizations of a country and they are politically motivated to attack a wide range of critical sections of another country [Ref](http://www.gideonrasmussen.com/article-14.html). 
 - The potential targets of these attacks include, but not limited to, executive civilian departments and agencies, private/public financial organizations (e.g., national/commercial banks), energy/waster infrastructures, and telecommunications and mobile service providers.
 - Cyberwar attackers can be considered as very well trained individuals with ample resources.
 - Attackers expend a great deal of time and resources towards disruption of services, which may severely paralyze a country and incur significant economic impacts.
