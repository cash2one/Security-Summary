## Advertise Mode


### 1. System structure
Online search advertising has three players: *Advertises*, *Publishers*, and *ad networks*

#### 1.1 Advertiser
Advertisers are who want to advertise a product or service

#### 1.2 Publishers
Publishers run websites(search engines, new sites, blog sites), mobile apps and games that display the ads. There are two kinds of publishers, 
- *publishers owned by the ad network*, e.g., google.com shows ads from Google's ad network
-  *publishers operated(O&O) by the  adnetwork*, e.g., ask.com is a syndicated publisher for Google ads
	
#### 1.3 Ad Networks
Ad networks(like Google AdSense, Bing Ads, Baidu, and Tahoo) that connect advertisers with the publishers.


### 2. Charching Scheme
**Cost-per-Click(CPC) or Pay-per-Click(CPC)**
It is the dominated charging model for search ads [[Parker-2012]](http://searchengineland.com/iab-pwc-search-still-tops-online-ad-revenues-and-share-grew-in-2011-118929). Advertisers pay the ad network only when their ad is clicked. Ad networks typically pay syndicated publishers 70% of the revenue generated by ad clicks on their site. 
- There are other charging models(e.g., pay per impression, pay per action), but this is not the dominate online ad revenues and ongoing trend.
