### Summary
In this paper, the author study the effects of randomly adapting one aspect of the system(role to VM mapping) in reducing attacker's sucess likelihood. 

### Strongness
- design simulation to study the effectiveness of moving target defense

### Weakness
- only experiment study, no theoretical model and analysis

### Learned 
- Simulation
  - They define adaption interval of the defender, which is the react time for the defender to refresh from attack. And then they show simulation result under different adaption interval. 


### Extension
