### Summary
- they categorize the DDoS flooding attacks 
- they classify exisiting countermeansures based on *where* and *when* they prevent, detect and response to the DDoS folloding attacks.
- moreover, they highlight the need for a comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach
- Note, I summarized their review in the [[DDoS Intro]](https://github.com/hxwang/Security-Summary/tree/master/DDoS)
