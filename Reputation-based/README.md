## Reputation-based Mechanism

#### Related work
- [[Du-2010]] We are aware that there have already been many researches focusing on building credit-based schemes for e-commerce [[Ketchpel-1996]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=507925), [[Atif-2002]](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kienhua/classes/COP6730/E-Commerce1.pdf) and peer-to-peer communities [[Resnick]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=355122) [[Xiong-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=998601), where each person responds to the peers' requests based on the community-based feed-back about past experiences of peers. 

- My Comments: `These reputation-based mechanism cannot be applied to our model, since these mechanism are limited to be used in the P2P applications`. 


#### TODO
- [ ] Think about why other reputation-based mechanisms cannot be applied in our designed system model.
