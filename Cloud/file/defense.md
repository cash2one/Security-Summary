### 1. Defense FRC attack
##### 1.1 Turing Tests
- Turing Tests [[Ahn-2004]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=966390) can be used to differentiate humans and attack clients.
- Drawbacks
    - Turing tests have been found to be unreliable and have been circumvented by mechanical Turks [[Bursztein-2010]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1849987) and puzzle breaking schemes [[Yan-2008]](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1455839)
    - Moreover, requiring a casual web users to solve a graphical puzzle to simply view is counter to the goals of the web application as some users are unable or simply unwilling to deal with the hassle [[Oikonomou-2009]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5199191&tag=1) [[Ranjan-2009]](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4555692)
